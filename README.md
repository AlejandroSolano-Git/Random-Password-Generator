# Random-Password-Generator
A random password generator that uses all letters, numbers, and symbols to create an 18-character password.

This password generator utilizes the math random built-in function alongside variables containing all the letters, upper and lower case, numbers, and special characters to create a password with a length of 18 characters as this combination would take with current computers 26 trillion years to crack (tech.co info). The length can always be edited as well.
